# Canvas App

This project aims to add an open source alternative to the default canvas web app with the addition of an open source desktop. This project was built with Tauri and React in order to be as future-proof and performant as possible. Tauri is an open source alternative to Electron.

## Goals
 - Completely replace the canvas web app
 - Doesn't aim to replace the quiz taking experience
 - Be as easy to use as possible
